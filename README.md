# Tech-K Android Challenge - Edgardo Barría Melián

This app is a front-end for the [Imgur API](https://apidocs.imgur.com/) and uses some of its functions as an anonymous user. The app is designed to work on Smartphones and Tablets.

This project has the following requirements and uses these libraries:

* Minimun SDK version: 21 (Lollipop 5.0)
* [JetBrains Anko](https://github.com/Kotlin/anko)
* [Retrofit 2 (With RxJava)](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)

All of the library dependencies are included in the app Gradle file (just needs a gradle sync to install all of them)
